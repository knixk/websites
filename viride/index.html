              <h2 class="heading">algae become a megatrend</h2>
              <p>Algae are climate savers. Algae can secure food. Algae have a gigantic potential. They may be small and only a few micrometers short. But they are a solution to the really big problems of our time: For our climate, because algae capture large amounts of CO2 through their constant growth. For our nutrition, because they contain valuable plant-based proteins and fats as well as many trace elements. At the same time, they do not compete for habitat and arable land. Viride exploits these advantages by growing algae in large, open saltwater basins in desert regions near the sea, where nothing else grows. We are convinced that the solution lies in microalgae â€“ they are a megatrend.</p>
